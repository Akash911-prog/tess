# Virtual Assistant Project - Roadmap & Tasks

This document outlines the roadmap and a comprehensive checklist of tasks for building the Electron-based Virtual Assistant.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] Initialize Electron project with Vite/React frontend
- [x] Configure development environment (ESM support, TypeScript/JavaScript setup)
- [x] Set up `electron-builder` or packaging system
- [x] Implement hot reload for development
- [x] Setup environment variables for APIs and config
- [x] Create `preload.js` (contextBridge) for secure communication
- [x] Linting & formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

## üé® Phase 2: UI/UX Design

- [ ] Design layout:
  - [ ] Chat area (message list, input box, send button)
  - [ ] AI indicator (pulsing animation, mic toggle)
  - [ ] Info area (weather, alarms, system info, quick actions)
- [ ] Create responsive grid/flexbox layout
- [ ] Implement dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Add animations (Framer Motion or CSS transitions)
- [ ] Set up icons (Lucide, custom set, or Material UI)
- [ ] Accessibility basics (keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels)

## üåê Phase 4: Web Search & Info Integration

- [ ] Implement web search (DuckDuckGo/Bing API/SerpAPI)
- [ ] Parse and summarize results
- [ ] Display formatted results in chat area
- [ ] Integrate weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- [ ] Add alarm/clock feature with notifications
- [ ] Info area modules:
  - [ ] Weather card
  - [ ] Alarm list
  - [ ] System info (battery %, CPU usage, memory)
  - [ ] Upcoming tasks/events

---

## üíª Phase 5: System Automation

- [ ] Implement OS-level commands through Electron main process
- [ ] Open installed applications
- [ ] File system operations (read/write/search files)
- [ ] Change system settings (brightness, volume, Wi-Fi toggle, etc.)
- [ ] Automate GUI tasks (robotjs / nut.js / AutoHotkey integration)
- [ ] Safety sandboxing for automation tasks

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Phase 6: Developer Features

- [ ] Code generation inside chat
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- [ ] Copy-to-clipboard button
- [ ] Option to run generated code snippets (sandboxed)
- [ ] Auto-formatting of code before output

---

## üîê Phase 7: Security & Permissions

- [ ] Secure contextBridge exposure
- [ ] Permissions check before running system tasks
- [ ] Safe fallback for failed automation
- [ ] Implement local encryption for sensitive data (tokens, passwords)

---

## ‚ö° Phase 8: Enhancements

- [ ] Offline mode with local model (optional)
- [ ] Plugin system for extending functionality
- [ ] Hotkey activation (global shortcut to trigger assistant)
- [ ] Background mode (minimize to tray)
- [ ] Notifications integration
- [ ] User settings UI:
  - [ ] API key manager
  - [ ] Custom hotkeys
  - [ ] Theme preferences
  - [ ] Automation preferences

---

## üöÄ Phase 9: Testing & Deployment

- [ ] Unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for IPC and automation
- [ ] UI testing (Playwright/Puppeteer)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Build installers with `electron-builder`
- [ ] Publish release (GitHub Releases or private)
